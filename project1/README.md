Project 1: Color Converter
Due date: Sep 24 at 11:59pm ET

Familiarize yourself with the following code. The three files provide a simple implementation of a color converter (CSS named colors, RGB values, hex-representation). If you are not understanding any part of the code, you should ask questions about it. You can discuss your questions with tutors, on Ed or during office hours.  You should run the program to see how the user interaction works, what arguments are expected when the program is executed, to see what happens when the user is not well behaved.

Once you understand the code (how it works, what it does, how the three classes interact, how the user interaction happens, how the file I/O works, â€¦), you will take a quiz on Brightspace that is based on the code.

The code for this project is in a shared workspace on Ed: https://edstem.org/us/courses/8850/workspaces/pO6NcEaJZfq3Cmeng6ZDhZ51uSp4nUbK 

The workspace contains project1 package with four files: Color.java, ColorConverter.java and ColorList.java, and an input file color_list.txt. You can download this code to your local machine or you can fork the workspace to be able to modify the files. All questions that refer to line numbers in the code should be answered based on the line numbers in the above workspace (not your own copy of it, since the line numbers might shift once you start editing the code).

The quiz will be available on Brightspace next week, but you should start working with the code right away. You will be given three attempts to complete the quiz. The highest score is the one that will count.
