# Module 2: Advanced Java 

This collection of Java source code files contains four stand alone programs: `Race01`, ..., `Race04`. 

Each program simulates a race between race contentenders (i.e., creatures that run in the race). 
In each program, the way these race contenders are defined changes: the different contenters gain their 
own characteristics, but also, they become more structured making it easier to simulate a race with many
contenders. 

Here is a breakdown of the files for each of the four programs:

__Race01__
- `Race01.java`
- `RaceContender01.java`

__Race02__
- `Race02.java`
- `RaceContender02.java`
- `Duck02.java`
- `Rabbit02.java`
- `Snail02.java` 

__Race03__
- `Race03.java`
- `RaceContender03.java`
- `Duck03.java`
- `Rabbit03.java`
- `Snail03.java` 

__Race04__
- `Race04.java`
- `RaceContender04.java`
- `Duck04.java`
- `Rabbit04.java`
- `Snail04.java`
